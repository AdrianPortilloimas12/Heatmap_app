# Heatmap generator

This shiny app takes Q3 normalized data generated from GeoMx DSP and generates 
a heatmap of the 20% more variable genes (variation computed on the filtered data).

User can select which annotations appear (and which levels), the names of the annotations
and their levels on the heatmap and the colors of the annotation bars.
